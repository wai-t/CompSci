# Sorting Algorithms

The algorithms implemented in the sorting demo are SelectionSort, InsertionSort, BubbleSort, QuickSort and MergeSort and the code is in sorting_algorithms.js
The sorting code implementation uses no advanced JavaScript constructs, except QuickSort and MergeSort demonstrate the use
of recursion in two different ways - namely: process current level before recursive call, and process current level after return
from recursive call, respectively.

The code in utils.js implements the animation for the demo. It implements asynchronous code and uses Promises, but mainly the reason
for this was to indulge my motivation to learn more Javascript.

By running the demos in index.html, I hope it will ignite your curiosity to research for more adequate descriptions of how they work
and, at a more advanced level, the pros/cons, performance characteristics, and suitability for various use cases. Issues arising can
be discussed in class.
