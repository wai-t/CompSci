# Data Structures

This folder contains an introduction to three common data structures<br/>
  Linked List<br/>
  Binary Search Tree</br>
  Hash Set</br>

There are also example implementations to show how an array, binary search tree and hash set can be searched in different ways:<br/>
  [Binary search on a sorted array](./binary_search.js)<br/>
  [Search on a Binary Search Tree](./tree_search.js)<br/>
  [Search on a Hash Set](./hash_search.js)<br/>

The manual script for the javascript array transitions demo is [here](./javascript_array_demo.md). 

Launch node with the --allow-natives-syntax and play around with creating and populating arrays and call %DebugPrint(...) to display the internals of the array.
