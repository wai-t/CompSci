# Computer Science
This repo contains presentation material, exercises, and the code for a demo of Computer Science concepts including data structures and algorithms.

In the Summer of 2024, the content maintained in this repo was delivered as a series of Workshops to to graduates at CodeYourFuture. The immediate and practical aim was to improve the chances of their CV generating an interview opportunity, and subsequently to demonstrate their new knowledge during the interview. In terms of personal development, I'm putting my faith in the idea that knowledge triggers the hunger for more knowledge. The content here is only small seed of that knowledge.
